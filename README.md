Comments: The website looks good and the implimentation of bootstrap for the navigation bar was clean and efficient. There are a couple formatting "errors" such as the"O" in the "Loki" image on the top right of the pages is slightly cut off which overall was not a big deal. The code is organized neatly and I liked the easter egg page. Good work overall
